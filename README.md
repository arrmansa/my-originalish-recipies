# 12-min-chocohotpot
A rapid version of Nigella Lawson's chocohotpot using a 3 in one microwave, convection, grill oven.

# Ingredients
100g 80% dark chocolate
100g butter
2 whole eggs
75g sugar
3 tbsp flour

# Tools
hand mixer with a dough mix attachment
500 ml glass measuring cup 
blowtorch
3 in one microwave, convection, grill oven.

## Recipie
Melt the chocolate and butter in a microwave (1 min 30s at 900W) then mix with a spoon. (In the glass measuring cup)
Put the sugar on top of this hot molten liquid so that it floats on it.
Put the flour after the sugar as well so that there is now an insulating layer over the chocolate.
Place the eggs and egg yolk on top of this hot mix
Now at once, dip the hand mixer into the measuring cup and mix it on low, while trying not to introduce too many air bubbles.
Once mixed, put a folded cloth on the counter and bump the bottom of the measuring cup against the toweled surface to bring some of the bubbles to the top.
Blowtorch the bubbles (technique from epoxy resin pouring) to pop them.
Pour evenly into 5 (microwave safe) glass bowls
Microwave for 1min 30s (or untill they start to rise / almost overflow) Grill on max for 1m 30s (to make the top foam layer set) and then convection at 230c for 2min (to finish the cooking)

serve warm with icecream


# 30-min-faux-meringue
A non-conventional rapid meringue recipe that results in a limited lifespan treat. (Warning - Uses magnesium)

## Ingredients

1 Egg white\
Powdered sifted sugar (25 gm)\
vanilla (4-5 drops)\
vinegar (2-3 drops)\
cream of tartar (1/8 tsp)\
Magnesium metal turnings - Grignard reagent grade (for dehydration)\
Electric beater

# Warning
Magnesium ignites at >500 °C and is fairly non-flammable, but burns hot (>2000 °C) and will explode if you put water on it - [youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZhO98hjXqI). \
Do not use magnesium powder - it may disperse in a convection oven.\
Do not microwave metal.

## Theories (that seem to work well)
1. Magnesium acts as a desicant at high temperatures as it converts water into magnesium hydroxide
2. Vinegar will helps the hardening process go faster

## Recipie

1. Put 1 small bowl of magnesium turnings into the oven and preheat to 180°C. This will decrease the humidity of the oven
2. Add 1 egg white and 1/8 tsp cream of tartar to a large bowl.
3. Beat until stiff peaks
4. Set the oven to 120°C preheat
5. Add sugar (25 gm), vanilla extract(4-5 drops) and vinegar (2-3 drops) and beat until glossy
6. Put small portions of resulting foam on a plate, place in the oven and bake at 110°C for 10 min and then 100°C for 20 min
7. Take out of oven and place in freezer immediately for 2 min to cool rapidly
8. Take out of freezer and consume within 5 min while still crispy.
9. These fax meringues become soggy rapidly and only stay crispy for a short time - even if stored in an airtight sealed container.
